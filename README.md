# Sunnys-Adventure
Midterm unity project for SVCollege.

The game, Sunny's Adventure, is a 2d platformer. You play Sonny the fox who can move, jump and climb ladders. The goal of the game is to take all the cherries in each stage
in the game and then get to his house. On the way you can also find diamonds, these are actually points in the game
with which we will check who is the first place in the leaderboards.

This project contains a demo to the game, with 1 fully developed level.
